This is an html based code that convertes voltage to temperature and temperature to voltage for T type and K type thermocouples. 
It primarily used co-efficients provided by NIST. 
However, the missing co-efficients at lower temperatures has been added through fitting that have accuracy around 0.05 K. 
To calculate voltage/temperature first select the type of Thermocouple and then input the value in the input field and press the enter key. 
The result will be shown on the result field.
